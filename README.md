# Python-HTTP-Proxy
The project mainly deals with creating a forward proxy server, using python which supports all HTTP sites and also implements caching, 
which removes the expired content from the cache data. The same code can also be used as a reverse proxy and it is also be used to 
monitor browsing activities.
